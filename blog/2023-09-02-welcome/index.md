Hello,

I build softwares. In this blog, I am determined to document all the necessary requirements for a software engineer to build & deploy softwares. 

With tons of information available it's very difficult to understand how to build and deploy applications. So here I wish to give a solution to an individual, where he/she can learn from building an application to deploying it to the cloud. I use JavaScript.

In this guides I try not to keep links/ highlight links so that readers don't get distracted from what they are reading. Usually every articles that I read online, people try to link a reference to another article, this can be a source of distraction.
