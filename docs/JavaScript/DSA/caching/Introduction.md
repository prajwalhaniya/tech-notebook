- Caching the process of storing the data into temporary memory so that it can be easily retrieved for later use if it is required again.

- The goal is to maximize hits (an item is in the cache when requested) & minimize misses (an item is not in the cache when requested)

- Web browsers cache HTML files, JavaScript, and images in order to load websites more quickly, while DNS servers cache DNS records for faster lookups and CDN servers cache content to reduce latency.

Two caching techniques:
- Least Frequently Used(LFU)
- Least Recently Used(LRU)
